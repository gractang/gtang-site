    I read once somewhere that the best way to start a sketchbook is to scribble on the very first page. Getting started is hard. I used to agonize over the very first page of my sketchbook. Surely it should be something special, right? Pages two, three, four, and so on are all easier to fill; after all, they're not the first look at my so-called artistic expertise. So, best to do away with the pressure and just scribble something simple.

    Now, The last page also creates anxiety for a budding artist. At least for me, I've always wanted to end the sketchbook with a culminating work that I'm proud of. But the nice thing about the last page is that it's not a last page at all. It's just a page. When you start a new sketchbook, you're not starting from scratch. You're starting from the last page of the previous sketchbook.

    In any case, this article serves as my first scribble, and first foray into publishing my writing online. I greatly respect those who share their thoughts with the world. The internet is a terrifying place -- and it is forever. I will certainly try to be thoughtful about what I share, but I don't doubt that I will write inaccuracies or later have revisions to make. My hope is that you will treat these mistakes with indulgence.
